### Hi there 👋

## 🔭 I’m currently working on ...

As a consultant and business owner, my projects are scattered across multiple services, accounts, and levels of privacy. Because of this, my github profile may look sparse and be unfairly used to judge how much I code. Please consider this if you are here as someone hiring or seeking my services. Thanks!

## 👨🏻‍💻 Technology I use

Primarily, Ruby on Rails but I've dabbled in just about everything
